# PoC-Predicting-Employee-Turnover
Employee turnover is very costly for organizations. Organizations such as consulting firms would suffer from deterioration in customer satisfaction 
due to regular changes in Account Reps and/or consultants that would lead to loss of businesses with clients.

This project is to build a classifier that help a client company predict employee turnover and reduce costs (such as recruitment, training, 
and replacement and so forth) which are caused by employee turnover.

Machine learning classification tools are advantageous data mining techniques to predict future employee behaviours (performance and attrition probabilities) 
based on past data trends. Based on the Human Resources past employee data mining and analysis, it is possible to predict future behaviours in the organization.
